# Spot_Painting 
In this project I used colorgram to generate a list of color codes from a preselected image. Using these color codes, my program randomly generates a new spot painting in each run. This project was created as part of a Udemy Course- 100 Days of Code:The Complete Python Bootcamp for 2022.
